You can test a limited set of Autodistill models using the [Roboflow Autodistill integration](https://docs.roboflow.com/annotate/automated-annotation-with-autodistill).

This integration enables you to preview the results of Autodistill models on your dataset from a web browser. The Autodistill Roboflow integration supports object detection and segmentation models we recommend as a starting point with Autodistill.

You can test Autodistill on up to five images at a time and see the results in your browser.

If Autodistill works as expected, you can use the code snippet generated by the integration to auto-label your full dataset.

To use the Roboflow Autodistill integration, you will need a [free Roboflow account](https://roboflow.com).
